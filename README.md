# stable-diffusion-discord-bot

A basic discord bot built to interface with the webserver api built into the lstein fork of stable-diffusion.
Currently only tested on windows 10 with an nvidia 1080ti 11gb.

You'll need to have https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion installed and working on your system first

To install bot dependancies : `npm install chokidar moment axios eris dotenv minimist`
Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your own details

Please read through the file and understand how it works.
There is no warranty and minimal support will be given, this is not a polished product and if your house catches fire its not my fault :)
Enjoy!
